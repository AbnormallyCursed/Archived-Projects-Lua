LAMBDA86 is a custom Instruction Set Architecture based off of the x86-64 ISA, 
it has some major bugs within the instruction cycle attributed to the Control Byte system but this project has been abandonded for the project of full x86-emulation.

The Control-Byte system was a custom idea that I had invented and was successful at what it sought out to do but at the cost of speed, hence why this project is now abandonded.
