This is a collection of random projects over the years, this in particular ranges from 2021-2024, a lot of these are not efficient as they were not intended to be used in large scale projects and were for practice and in general the fun of programming them.
As such they can be considered highly archaic or in general of low quality.
All of these systems are intended to be paired with their respective roblox files such as models, and decals, so these will not work without them.

Reminder: Full projects can be shown upon request.
